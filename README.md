Upon visualizing the data, the four groups appear to be quite distinct:

The first group shows a clear linear relationship between x and y.
The second group, on the other hand, exhibits a non-linear pattern, indicating that the usual Pearson correlation may not be appropriate to describe the dataset.
The third group would be linear if it were not for a single outlier.
The fourth group demonstrates that y can have different values for the same x, suggesting that there is no clear relationship between x and y. However, there is also an outlier in this group.
These four groups illustrate that summary statistics alone are not sufficient for investigating data. Visualizing the data, analyzing possible outliers, and identifying more complex relationships are essential to gain a better understanding of the underlying patterns in the data.
